Exercise with Progressive enhancement

Exercise :

    Translate this txt document into semantic html, using the right html tags : h1, h2, blockquote, q, img, p, hr, figure and caption, table, th, tr, td, ul or ol and li.
    
    No div or span: they do not provide any semantics.
        
    Add two or three links of your choice in the html page via the tag a
    
    Is there a part that could be considered as a header? If so, group it in a header tag.
    And a footer? If so, group this content together in a footer tag
    Put all instances of the words "Maybe" in a em or strong tag.

What did I learn?

    I've learned the proper way of:
        - Using html tags for a pure semantic html
        - Working with css (colors, backgrounds, etc...)
        - Making tables and list
        - Embed a Youtube video into my html page.
        - Insert a link for my social media pages 

    This is the first one pager I've ever made so I was proud about the end result.

    Code: 
    The code I used for this exercise is simple beginners code for a static website.
